## Data Collection

**If you log in to the game with your Unity account, then and only then will we collect/share 3 different pieces of information summed up below.**

We collect 3 information pieces:
1. Your player ID: Used for internal data structure so it's never shared with other users. It's automatically and randomly generated so it's no personal information.
2. Your username: You'll be asked to enter a username, this username will be collected, saved and shared with other users.
                  There's already a predefined username so if you don't want this information to be collected, saved and shared, you can keep the predefined username.
3. Your score: After a game, you'll get a score that defines how well you've played the game.
               This info will be collected, saved and shared with other users. 

All of this information will be saved on a server. You can delete all 3 information pieces using this guide: https://github.com/xSutai/ninja_jump/blob/main/ExtraExplanation.md
